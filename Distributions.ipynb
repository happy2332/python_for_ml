We will mainly be dealing with two probability distributions : Bernoulli Distribution (for discrete variables), and Normal Distribution (for continuous variables).\n",

    "Consider a binary random variable $X$ i.e. it can have two possible outcomes. Let the two outcomes be 0 and 1. An example of such random variable is the outcome of a coin toss. The distrbution is parameterized by a single parameter $\\phi$,  whose value can be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Intuitively, $\\phi$ tells the probability of $X=1$\n",

For that, we need to sample many points, and then we would be able to verify. So now in the following code, we sample 100 points with $\\phi=0.4$, and compute their average. You should run this code for $\\phi=0.7$, and compute the average of the sampled points. Is the average close to 0.7 ? What happens when you increase the number of samples ?"

As we increase the number of samples, sample means are different but are closer to each other. We want to find distribution of these sample means.
