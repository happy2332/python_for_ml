    "During the course, we will be dealing with a lot of probability distributions. So it is a good idea to get familiar with these distributions. We will mainly be dealing with two probability distributions : Bernoulli Distribution (for discrete variables), and Normal Distribution (for continuous variables).\n",

    "Consider a binary random variable $X$ i.e. it can have two possible outcomes. Let the two outcomes be 0 and 1. An example of such random variable is the outcome of a coin toss. The distrbution is parameterized by a single parameter $\\phi$,  whose value can be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Intuitively, $\\phi$ tells the probability of $X=1$ i.e.\n",

    "Here are some questions for you to understand this distribution in more detail :\n",
    "1. Find the expected value of $X$ in terms of $\\phi$.\n",
    "2. Find the variance of $X$ in terms of $\\phi$.\n",
    "3. Now suppose we want to sample a point from a Bernoulli distribution with a given $\\phi$. Then we can do that using numpy's binomial function. The code below shows how to sample a point for $\\phi=0.4$."
